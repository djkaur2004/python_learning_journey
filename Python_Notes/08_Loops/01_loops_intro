# What are Loops in Python?

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.
👉 Instead of writing the same code again and again, we use loops.

# Types of loops in Python

- for loop
- while loop

# Difference between for loop and while loop

| for loop                                | while loop                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Used when number of iterations is known | Used when condition is based on logic |
| Iterates over sequences                 | Runs till condition is False          |
| Safer and cleaner                       | Risk of infinite loop                 |
