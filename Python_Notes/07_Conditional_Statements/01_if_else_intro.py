# SHORT HAND IF ELSE STATEMENTS
''' There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being
tested is simple and the code block to be executed are short. Eg:- '''
a = 330

print("A") if a>b else print("=") if a==b else print("B")

# Writing else with double quotes is important otherwise the code will show error
print(9) if a<b else ""
# OR
c = 9 if a>b else 0
print(c)
